## Jikes Research Virtual Machine

Jikes RVM (Research Virtual Machine) provides a flexible open testbed to prototype virtual machine technologies and experiment with a large variety of design alternatives. The system is licensed under the [EPL](http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html), an [OSI](http://www.opensource.org/) approved license. Jikes RVM runs on IA32 32 bit (64 bit support is work in progress) and PowerPC (big endian only).

A distinguishing characteristic of Jikes RVM is that it is implemented in the Javaâ„¢ programming language and is self-hosted i.e., its Java code runs on itself without requiring a second virtual machine. Most other virtual machines for the Java platform are written in native code (typically, C or C++). A Java implementation provides ease of portability, and a seamless integration of virtual machine and application resources such as objects, threads, and operating-system interfaces.

More information is available at our [website](http://www.jikesrvm.org).

## Building

You'll need

* a JDK (>= 6)
* Ant (>= 1.7) with optional tasks
* GCC with multilibs
* Bison
* an internet connection during the first build to download [GNU Classpath](http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/) and other components

Please see the [user guide](http://www.jikesrvm.org/UserGuide/) for more details.
